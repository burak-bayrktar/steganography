# steganography
 Simple steganography example with libpng and recaman number sequence. 
 Below is an example of which points are being written. This is achieved by simply embedding the data 
 into MSB instead of LSB, so the color data(in this case R) is increased slightly.

 Read and wirte functions are taken from Guillaume Cottenceau's example.
